# C++ Practice Projects

This repository contains original **C++ tasks** completed as part of my **personal practice and learning journey**.

Tasks Practiced

1. **Task 1 - Number Guessing Game**
   A simple game where the user guesses a random number within a defined range.

2. **Task 2 - Simple Calculator**
   A console-based calculator performing basic arithmetic operations.

3. **Task 3 - Tic Tac Toe**
   A 2-player Tic Tac Toe game in the terminal.

Folder Structure

* `Task1_NGG/` → Number Guessing Game code
* `Task2_SC/` → Simple Calculator code
* `Task3_TTT/` → Tic Tac Toe game code


### Notes

* All code is written **from scratch** for learning purposes.
* AI tools have been used **only for refactoring or optimization suggestions**. If anything looks off or behaves unexpectedly, **feel free to raise an issue** — I code, I learn, I fix!
