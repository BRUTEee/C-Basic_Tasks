This repo contains my original work for the C++ Programming Internship at CodSoft.

Tasks Included:
- Number Guessing Game  
- Simple Calculator  
- Tic-Tac-Toe Game

Each task has its own folder with code brief and info.

This repository is part of my personal learning and internship journey. All code is written originally and with the goal of understanding C++ better and not just completing the internship, but **growing as a developer**.

Thanks for visiting!
Feel free to explore the folders, read the code and drop feedback if you have suggestions!
